# Chapter 2 — Excel Formulas & Functions (Practice)

## Overview
This chapter focuses on hands-on practice with core Excel formulas and functions across multiple categories.  
Guided files were used as a reference structure, while formulas were written and tested independently.

## Topics Covered
- Formulas & Functions Introduction  
- Logical Functions  
- Math Functions  
- Statistical Functions  
- Array Formulas  
- Lookup Functions  
- Text Functions  
- Date & Time Functions  

## How This Work Differs from Guided Examples
- Used guided files as a learning reference, not final answers  
- Modified data values to test formula behavior under different conditions  
- Rewrote formulas manually to reinforce syntax and logic  
- Validated outputs by changing inputs rather than replicating pre-filled examples output  
- Practiced independent troubleshooting of formula errors  

## Skills Practiced
- Writing and debugging Excel formulas  
- Applying logical and conditional functions  
- Performing mathematical and statistical analysis  
- Using lookup functions with correct references  
- Manipulating text data programmatically  
- Working with date and time calculations  

## Key Learning Takeaway
This chapter strengthened my ability to write, test, and validate Excel formulas independently, focusing on understanding how functions behave rather than memorizing outputs.
