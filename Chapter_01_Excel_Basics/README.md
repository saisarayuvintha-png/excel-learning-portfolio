# Chapter 1 — Excel Basics (Guided Practice)

## What this is
This workbook represents my Excel practice for Chapter 1 (Excel Basics).
I followed a guided learning structure and practiced the steps independently.

## Dataset usage
- The dataset structure was provided as part of the learning material
- I modified many values to test calculations and formatting
- Some values remained the same where changes were not required

## Skills practiced
- Cell formatting (number, date, currency)
- Tables
- Sorting and filtering
- Basic calculations

## Files
- Chapter_1_Basic_Practice.xlsx

## Differences from guided examples

- Used guided files as a learning framework while practicing steps independently
- Modified multiple data values to validate calculations and formatting behavior
- Applied ribbon tools and formatting manually through hands-on exploration
- Regenerated final outputs based on updated inputs rather than copying results
- Organized practice across multiple files to reflect different Chapter 1 concepts


## Notes
This work reflects my hands-on Excel practice and understanding of the concepts.
